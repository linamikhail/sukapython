Firstly, thank you for reading this README. Not many people will do so. So you're in that elusive 9%.
This is just a simple randomizer script using python.
To try it out make sure you have Python 3.x installed and just run the codes.
To install Python 3.x on Windows, read here: https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html
For other OS options, read here: https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html
Do remember where you've installed Python on Windows, usually its at: C:\Python34
